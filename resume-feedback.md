# Resume Feedback for Kelly

Based on comparing your resume to mine and the feedback I got from an instructor about making summaries more personable and voice-driven.

---

## Summary - Needs a Voice

**Your current:**
> "Tech-forward VP operations leader with 10+ years scaling multi-site service operations across 350+ locations. Delivered 50% efficiency gains, 20%+ margin growth, and modern, tech-enabled QA across distributed operations."

**The problem:** This reads like a job description written in reverse. It's all adjectives and stats with no personality. There's no "you" in it.

**My summary for comparison:**
> "Former CPO who ships fast. Currently building conversational AI at Balance (60% retention). I've delivered 90-day platform turnarounds, shipped products in under 40 days, and scaled teams through Series B growth."

Notice: "Who ships fast." "I've delivered." It reads like a person talking.

**Suggested rewrite:**
> "I build operational systems that scale. At RPC, I cut overhead 50% across 350+ dealerships. At IATSE, I delivered the first contract wins in 15 years while managing $4-5M budgets. Now expanding into AI-powered automation to help operations teams move faster and more reliably."

## Other Recommendations

### 1. Title Context
"VP of Operations" at RPC could raise eyebrows without context. Add company descriptors inline like I do:

**Mine:** "Balance (AI-Powered Financial Forecasting)"

**Yours currently:** Has "(BMW joint venture)" on a separate line - easy to miss

**Suggested:** "The Retail Performance Company (BMW Joint Venture L&D Agency)"

---

### 2. Bullet Structure - Lead with Impact

Your bullets sometimes bury the impact at the end. Flip them.

**Current:**
> "Selected and implemented payment operations platform, creating centralized invoice tracking system; built audit-ready financial infrastructure referenced by third-party accounting firm"

**Revised:**
> "Built audit-ready financial infrastructure referenced by third-party accounting firm; implemented Stripe for centralized invoice tracking across all client projects"

**Current:**
> "Overhauled training coordination for 350+ dealerships with Airtable/Zapier automations that cut overhead 50% and was replicated org-wide"

**Revised:**
> "Cut training operations overhead 50% across 350+ dealerships with Airtable/Zapier automations; system replicated org-wide as standard"

---

### 3. IATSE Section is Too Long

You have 6 bullets vs 3-5 for other roles. Suggestions:

- **Cut "Crisis Management"** - it's vague and doesn't add differentiation
- **Merge "Multi-Stakeholder Systems Design" into "Systems Building at Scale"** - they overlap

**Revised IATSE section (4 bullets):**

> - Built field rep tracking system for 6 reps across 10-30 simultaneous productions; served training, EEOC/OSHA compliance, contract enforcement, and analytics for multiple stakeholder groups
> - Delivered first improvements to mileage reimbursement and housing allowance language in 15+ years through high-stakes negotiations and consistent agreement enforcement
> - Managed $4-5M operating budgets and 8-12 staff across shared services, benefits, IT, field operations, accounting, and reception
> - Maintained systems built for EEOC, OSHA, and federal labor board scrutiny; ensured workers made whole under collective bargaining agreements

---

### 4. Core Competencies Section

I don't have one. It's resume filler that takes space without differentiating you.

**If you keep it:** Make it specific. "Airtable/Zapier Automation" is better than "Technology Implementation"

**My recommendation:** Cut it and use the space for a stronger summary or another bullet point.

---

### 5. Missing Direction Signal

My summary ends with where I'm headed: "Bringing that same execution rigor to AI"

Yours doesn't signal what you want next. The suggested summary above adds this:
> "Now expanding into AI-powered automation to help operations teams move faster and more reliably."

This tells employers: she's not just looking for any job, she has a direction.

---

### 6. LC Co Quarter Horses Date

"2020 - Ongoing/2025" is confusing. Pick one:
- "2020 - Present" (if still active)
- "2020 - 2025" (if ended)
